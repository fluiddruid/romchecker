ROMChecker
==========

A simple script to check for the existence of the new nightly build of a ROM and
send a Pushover notification (http://pushover.net/) to an Android device if it
finds one.

I wrote this to check for the nightly builds of the excellent PAC-ROM 
(http://http://pac-rom.com), but it will work for other ROM. which have date 
stamped nightlies on a publicly accessible web server.
