romchecker
==========

A simple python script to check for the existence of the new nightly build of a ROM and send a Pushover notification (http://pushover.net/) to an Android device if it finds one.

I wrote this to check for the nightly builds of the excellent PAC-ROM (http://pac-rom.com), but it will work for other ROMs which have dates-tamped nightlies on a publicly accessible web server.
